# Tina - Work in Progress. still under development

[Project Board](https://github.com/users/bradyfontenot/projects/4)

~~**ALPHA STAGE**
This is an early version of an elixir api wrapper for Alpaca Markets. I suggest
using it extensively in a paper trading environment before trusting it for live
trading.  At this point it has not been stress tested.~~

Implements all endpoints, alpaca streaming data, and polygon data
along with a few additional conveniences.
